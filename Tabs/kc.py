            The diabetes care system is an advanced, data-driven platform designed to detect diabetes type and its stage using numerical data from medical test datasets. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes key health metrics such as blood glucose levels, HbA1c, insulin levels, and BMI to classify the type of diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, or prediabetes) and determine its progression stage. This automated detection process ensures accurate and timely diagnosis, enabling healthcare providers to intervene early. The system is user-friendly, allowing patients to upload their medical test results directly, and it generates a comprehensive analysis within seconds.
